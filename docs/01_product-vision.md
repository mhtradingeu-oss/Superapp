# Product Vision for MH-OS

## What is MH-OS?
MH-OS is a Brand Operating System designed to orchestrate an entire company—from pricing and catalog, through marketing, loyalty, CRM, finance, and operations—by combining modular business services, an AI “crew” that acts as department heads, and automation layers. It treats each brand as a tenant with a virtual office where AI directors converge with humans to plan and run the business. The platform emphasizes live intelligence, guardrails, and a “command center” mindset, making it possible to run a brand end-to-end with minimal human overhead.

## Why a global Brand OS?
Because MH-OS spans governance (IAM, RBAC, policy seeding), domain data (products, pricing, campaigns, loyalty, finance), and intelligence (AI HQ, insights, assistants, pricing AI), it becomes the single system of record and action layer for multi-channel brands. Brands can launch, price, market, sell, collect payments, retain customers, and monitor health without stitching together disparate tools. The AI crew + automations ensure every discipline stays aligned, while the platform owner retains visibility and control.

## Personas
1. **Platform Admin (Platform Owner)**  
   Oversees tenant on-boarding, RBAC, feature flags, AI policies, health metrics, and platform-level automations. Lives in the admin plane and monitors notifications, activity, and maintenance tools.
2. **Brand Owner / Operator**  
   Runs a specific brand (e.g., HAIROTICMEN). Focuses on commerce, pricing, marketing programs, CRM, loyalty, finance, and automation campaigns. Wants actionable KPIs, AI-driven recommendations, and Virtual Office outputs tailored to their brand.
3. **Sales Rep / Field Team**  
   Tracks territories, routes, quotes, and deals connected to MH-OS pipelines; receives pricing guidance, loyalty incentives, and automation nudges generated by the platform.
4. **End Customer / Consumer**  
   Engages via front-facing experiences (HAIROTICMEN storefront, loyalty wallet, product catalog) and receives personalized recommendations from the AI assistant.
5. **AI Department Heads**  
   Pricing Director, Marketing Director, CRM Lead, Loyalty Lead, Finance Lead, Operations/Inventory Lead, etc. Each is an AI agent with domain expertise, producing insights, drafts, guardrails, and action items within their plane.

## Planes
### Admin Plane
- Platform-level views: tenants, RBAC, AI policies, automations, systems health, notifications, activity logs, audit trails, and integrations.
- Controls global feature flags, seed data (HAIROTICMEN, products, AI configs), and platform-wide automations.
- Hosts the AI HQ, AI insights, reports, and assistant that service platform owners and orchestrators.

### Business / Brand Plane
- Brand-scoped experiences: commerce (products, pricing, inventory), growth (CRM, marketing, loyalty), finance, automations, notifications, and dashboards.
- Brand owner works here on KPIs, pricing strategies, campaigns, loyalty programs, finance oversight, and direct interactions with AI suggestions per domain.
- Builds on the same backend modules currently powering the admin UI; eventually exposes a more polished “brand owner” shell.

### Virtual Office Plane
- Cross-functional, meeting-style interface where the AI Department Heads convene (with the founder/owner) to align on strategy, risks, and next steps.
- Inputs come from any combination of domains (campaign performance, pricing drafts, CRM health, inventory alerts).
- Outputs are action items, decisions, guardrails, and automations that get channeled back into Business and Admin planes.

## How the personas interact with MH-OS
1. **Create a brand (HAIROTICMEN)** – seeded via admin plane; product catalog, pricing, AI configs, loyalty programs, and automations already bootstrapped.
2. **Brand owner onboards products/pricing** – uses product management + pricing editor; enters costs, guardrails, VAT, and channels; reviews AI suggestions generated in the pricing module or Virtual Office with the Pricing Director.
3. **Sales & marketing activation** – marketing campaigns, CRM leads, loyalty tiers, finance records, and inventory transactions feed into KPIs. AI crew observes signals and surface insights/reports in AI HQ.
4. **Virtual Office meeting** – founder triggers a meeting (e.g., “German launch pricing review”); AI heads provide recommendations, flag risks, and assign action items. These feed automations, notifications, and the activity log.
5. **Daily operations** – Brand owner monitors dashboards (commerce, growth, money), reviews AI suggestions, approves pricing drafts, tracks loyalty health, and ensures finance figures align with goals.
6. **Platform admin oversight** – monitors system health, AI performance, automations, and compliance; uses notifications/activity to intervene when necessary.

# Stand / POS Partner OS & Sales Rep Engine
MH-OS Phase 5 builds a Stand / POS Partner OS and Sales Rep Engine that hook directly into the Business/Brand Plane. Stand Partners (salons, pharmacies, pop-up stands) get onboarding, refill flows, loyalty status, QR/payment metadata, and early payout tracking tied to HAIROTICMEN (plus future brands). Sales reps orchestrate territories, leads, visits, quotes, orders, and commissions while collaborating with AI agents to surface opportunities, follow-ups, and virtual office discussion points.

Both domains feed into the AI crew: the Stand Director watches refill alerts, package uptake, and partner loyalty so the Ops/Finance agents can advise payouts and automations; the Sales Director monitors pipelines, visit outcomes, and commission health so the CRM, Marketing, and Finance agents stay synchronized. Virtual Office meetings can now include Stand + Sales reviews focused on rollout cadence, refill automation triggers, and territory performance stories.

## HAIROTICMEN as the pilot brand
HAIROTICMEN is the living test case that houses seeded products, pricing, AI agents, loyalty programs, and automations. It acts as the exemplar brand used to validate MH-OS workflows, guardrails, and AI orchestration. Every module referenced in the platform (pricing, campaigns, CRM, loyalty, finance, virtual office, AI HQ) points back to HAIROTICMEN for navigation, benchmarking, and storytelling, ensuring new features ship with a real-world, concrete brand experience.
